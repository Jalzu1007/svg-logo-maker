# svg-logo-maker

## Description

This project is a Node.js command-line application that generates a logo in SVG format based on user input. The application prompts the user to enter text, select a color and shape, and then saves the generated SVG as a .svg file.

The motivation behind building this project is to provide a simple logo generation tool for freelance web developers who need a logo for their projects without having to rely on a graphic designer.

The SVG Logo Maker solves the problem of creating a custom logo quickly and easily without the need for graphic design skills or expensive software.

Throughout the development of this project, I gained experience in using Node.js, working with command-line applications, handling user input, generating SVG files, and writing tests using Jest.

## Usage

Once the application is running, follow the prompts to generate your logo. You will be asked to enter text, select a color for the text, choose a shape from a list (circle, triangle, or square), and select a color for the shape. After providing input for all the prompts, the application will create an SVG file named logo.svg and display the message "Generated logo.svg" in the command line.
