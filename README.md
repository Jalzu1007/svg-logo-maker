# svg-logo-maker

## Description

This project is a Node.js command-line application that generates a logo in SVG format based on user input. The application prompts the user to enter text, select a color and shape, and then saves the generated SVG as a .svg file.

The motivation behind building this project is to provide a simple logo generation tool for freelance web developers who need a logo for their projects without having to rely on a graphic designer.

The SVG Logo Maker solves the problem of creating a custom logo quickly and easily without the need for graphic design skills or expensive software.

Throughout the development of this project, I gained experience in using Node.js, working with command-line applications, handling user input, generating SVG files, and writing tests using Jest.

## Installation

To install and run the SVG Logo Maker, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project's directory using the command line.
3. Run the command npm install to install the required dependencies.
4. Run the command node index.js to start the application.

## Usage

Once the application is running, follow the prompts to generate your logo. You will be asked to enter text, select a color for the text, choose a shape from a list (circle, triangle, or square), and select a color for the shape. After providing input for all the prompts, the application will create an SVG file named logo.svg and display the message "Generated logo.svg" in the command line.
